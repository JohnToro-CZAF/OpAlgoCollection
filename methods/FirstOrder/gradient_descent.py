  An intuitive choice for descent direction d is the direction of steppest
  descent. Following the direction of steepest descent is guranteed to lead
  to improvement provided that the objective function is smooth, the step size
  is sufficiently small, and we are not already at a point where the gradient
  is zeo. The direction of steppest descent is the direction opposite the 
  gradient âˆ‡f, hence the name gradient descent.
